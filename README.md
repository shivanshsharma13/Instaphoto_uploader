# Instagram Photo Uploader

![Instagram uploader](image.jpg "Instagram")

This is a simple python program that asks your instagram userID and Password and after that your image and caption. After that, it checks whether image is in ratio 1:1 or not.
If not, it also changes your image to 1:1 ratio and upload you image in instagram for a real time.

## Key points

- We uses `instagram Bot` for performing our tasks and several times login will create problem with the privacy, so take care of that
- We uses `Pillow` for image modifications
- We uses `pyttsx3` for voice assistance
